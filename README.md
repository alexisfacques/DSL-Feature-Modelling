# Hack your Domain-Specific Language - Alexis Facques

Domain-Specific Languages (DSL) - Master Cloud Computing & Services Project - Universit√© de Rennes 1

Domain-Specific Language (DSL) development for modelling variability, using **JAVA**, **Eclipse XTEXT and XTEND**.
This includes :
- Creating an abstract syntax and grammar for our DSL;
- Developing model transformations towards other file formats (JSON, Natural Language, CNF);
- Solving (Deadlock feature detection, satisfiability...) random Feature Models using our DSL and implemented solvers such as [Sat4J](http://www.sat4j.org/).

Practical uses of our DSL will be shown through the development of a feature model configurator, using **NodeJS**.
